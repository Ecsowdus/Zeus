### Bill of Material  
The following Section will describe in detail the different parts needed for your own SpotMicroESP32 build, with at least some rough estimate of the price.

|               ESP32-DevKitC               |    1x    | The core MCU for the build with WIFI + BLE capabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Tested |        €7        |               |
|                 ESP32-CAM                 |    1x    | Tested with the ESP32-Module with OV2640 Camera (version 2). There are also cameras with a version 1 OV2640, where the sensor is in landscape orientation and not in portrait. Also the flexcable seems to be some millimeters shorter than the one from Version 2. You can distinguish them by the imprint on the flexcable, stating TY-OV2640-V2.0. Both OV2640 Cameras should work in theory, as the part is designed to fit both models. Definetly dont go with the one with an fisheye-lens or other variations - the field of view would be hindered and most likely the lens would not fit through the hole anyway. | Tested |        €10       |               |
|          FT232RL USB-TTL-Adapter          |    1x    | USB-to-Serial Adapter for ESP32-CAM flashing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Tested |        €2        |               |
|               DS3218MG Servo              |    12x   | 20Kg servos with metal gears and ball bearings. Much less play and in my tests no jittering, but also very strong. With these your robot should be able to walk significantly better. Maybe only 4 of these are enough, when used in the lower legs - the most stressed parts. Maybe you would need also 4 additional ones for the upper legs - but maybe MG996R are enough here. The shoulders should be comfortable with MG996R, as these dont do much heavy work.                                                                                                                                                       | Tested | €15 - €20 / each |               |
